So 5 hours of „work“ for one hookup. Not counting in the additional missed time unsuccessfully chatting and the two dates that led to nothing (maybe still a nice date though). Supposed the intent is just having sex, if he earns median income those 5 hours could probably already pay for a decent professional service. If more than median income it gets even more inefficient.",False,1694557358.0,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/16fzts6/my_tinder_data_from_about_2_years_german_m22_oc/k0bo4sq/,1
361,k0bpbfr,False,Solace-,"As a dude in their late 20s Tinder has been an interesting case study into how superficial people can be—which isn’t a surprise on dating apps. I found far more success when I actually included my height (above 6ft. tall) and added a couple photos of myself in sleeveless shirts than before I did either of those things.  It is what it is and I don’t fault any of the type of people who use apps like this, especially in this day and age when going out and meeting people is time consuming. But I don’t think that some of the things people focus on are healthy and is exacerbated by how many people they can select from.  Like how many women are missing out on a good guy because they thought a dude being 5’ 9” or whatever was a deal breaker? Or how many men missed out on a good woman because of a similar very specific preference?",False,1694557817.0,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/16fzts6/my_tinder_data_from_about_2_years_german_m22_oc/k0bpbfr/,1
