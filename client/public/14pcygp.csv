Northwest Territories on the other hand had an increase in homicides from 2 in 2019, to 6 in 2020.

Yukon did have the 3rd highest rate of violent criminal code violations (5.091/100k) behind Nunavut and the Northwest Territories.

I felt safer as a 20 yr old woman living by myself, in a worse part of town in 2010, than I do now as a married 30-something in a “nice” part of town. A old lady was dragged to death in a car jacking near my house, by teenagers skipping school. There have been multiple murders in public in the same few blocks. One was a server shot execution style while waiting on a outdoor table. This is in a nice, heavily trafficked, families-going-to-the-grocery store part of town, all in the last 2 years. People won’t get gas with their kids in the car because there are so many carjackings. 

It boggles my mind that Chicago and San Francisco get all of this coverage about out of control crime, while the media is silent on New Orleans. We are statistically worse in every way (by a lot). We are #1 In the nation in per capita murders, the only US city in top 10 for murders per capita on the world list, every other one on the list were Mexican cartel cities.",false,1688425424.0,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/14pcygp/oc_homicide_rate_per_100000_people_by_us_state/jqkejes/,34

They had them stationed in the event center by the river in New Orleans, and they would patrol and sit in front of business likely to be looted. He said their first night out they pulled into a Lowe's parking lot, and not even 30 minutes later a dozen shots went off about a block away. They weren't tasked to investigate, only sit and make sure no one broke in the store. A while later a cop sped up to them and asked if they heard shots, because an off duty officer was shot in a head not far from their location. Only grazed, but that's insane. 

He also said several of his buddies had guys threaten to pull guns on them. No one was ever shot thankfully. 

He said there was gunfire every night. The cops were short staffed as well because no one wants to be a cop in New Orleans with all that going on. The only way you were getting arrested was if you killed someone, because there was so much crime and so little enforcement available.

307,jqi7xlj,false,Ok_Ad_7939,"Even ignoring color-blindness, the white looks like the absence of something. I see by the scale that green is better than white, but it’s still confusing to look at the big picture with white being worse than green. And black is the worst?  Again it’s begging white to be the best.   A scale with white in the middle of two colors is suited for a measurement with positives and negatives. For instance pH. Base could be one color, acid could be another color, and white is balanced (7 I think). 

The other thing is, are these annual homicide rates really all that different?  

First, homicide rate > murder rate.  A homicide is a death at the hands of a human.  That includes accidental and justifiable. 

Second, black represents 15 of 100,000. That’s 1.5 basis points (percent of a percent).  That’s far from the max possible, particularly given how many guns we have. The news media feed and the general populace believe this narrative that every black person and white fascist is out there killing people every month. We certainly have a lot more murder than we’d like, but your risk of being killed is still fairly low.  

So there’s 3 things I find wrong with your color selection:  
1. It’s not color-blind friendly, 
2. The data are a one-directional gradation but your color scale is suited for opposites with a happy medium.

They enlisted people to be part of a psychology study. But before they started, they'd ask the person to go get a file. This was the real test. The person would go into a room with cabinets, purposefully designed to be too small for people to easily walk past each other, and then someone who was part of the test would purposefully bump into the study participant and call the study participant an asshole before (trying to) walk away. This was the test, how do you respond when someone else bumps into you then says it was your fault?

Most people didn't react much -- it wasn't a big deal to most people. Some people are just jerks, right? No real harm done, move on. But people (especially men) from the South-east of the US or ""the South"" (ignoring Southern California/Arizona/New Mexico) got all hot and bothered by that. They were ready to fight!
