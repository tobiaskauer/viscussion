67,jmjpuy0,makesyoudownvote,"I think the perceived trust of others is a factor along with the perception that they are the establishment or the default. 

Fox and InfoWars are objectively less credible than CNN and MSNBC, but everyone knows that, even conservatives who do put trust in those news sources. They generally take their news with a degree of skepticism... except when it tells them something they already believe. 

CNN and MSNBC tout themselves as being unbiased and accurate and many people take that at face value. It goes often completely unchallenged and swallowed hookline and sinker. The vehemence of distrust of those sources is sort of compensating for the blind trust they perceive others to have of it.

Think of it this way. Look at chain restaurants vs mom and pop restaurants. A small sandwich shop might be able to get away with loose health standards. They might not keep their tuna at a perfect temperature. They might keep their cooked meats next to their raw meats in the back. They might even accidentally get someone sick once in a while, but no one would care or fault them. If they generally have good tasting sandwichs the yelp reviews will be 4.5 or higher. If they make sandwiches that aren't for a particular person that person will probably just not eat there and not leave reviews. If someone has a bad experience they will usually still give it 3-4 stars. If they have a good experience it will get 5 stars and people feel like they are helping out a small business. 

A Subway sandwiches on the other hand will almost never get above 4 stars no matter how exceptional they are. They absolutely have to adhere to the most rigorous of safety standards or they can lose the ability to keep the franchise. Their food is the result of decades and millions of dollars of market research. If you took 100 people who had never had either restaurant and had never heard of Subway the majority of them would probably say Subway was better. But because it's a chain and well known and people have had their sandwiches many times in their lives, even a slight deviation from that standard will yield one star reviews. Not 3 or 4 stars but 1. In fact 3-4 star reviews are usually going to be representive of a good experience. They have to be blown away in some way usually to give a Subway a 5 star review.

People generally hate subway because it's perceived as the establishment, and are very quick to share and perpetuate exaggerated facts (like the cake vs bread finding in Ireland) or even obviously false facts (Subway Tuna isn't really tuna). 

CNN and MSNBC are perceived as ""the establishment"" in much the same way. People who like them are looked down upon for being sheep just like people who like Subway or McDonald's instead of the more unique Ivy's Sandwiches or Bob's Burgers.",false,1685731466.0,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/13xwtgn/oc_trust_in_media_2023_what_news_outlets_do/jmnbv61/,jmnbv61

119,jmjsv4p,BackAlleySurgeon,"I think Democrats and Republicans understood the question differently, which is what resulted in some strange results. If I took this survey, I'd believe it was asking, essentially, how often the organization tells outright truths or outright lies. When Republicans refer to fake news, they typically are referring to biased news. So, for example, if the New York Times ran several front page stories on the Trump classified documents scandal, and only ran a few minor stories on the Biden document scandal, I'd say that's indicative of trustworthiness; they didn't lie about anything. Republicans would consider that indicative of untrustworthiness; the reporting was biased (in their eyes at least).

So, I don't regularly see things from OAN or Newsmax, but I'd assume that most of their coverage is factual, although likely biased. So they may run non-stop news stories about the Biden document scandal and only a few minor stories about Trump's document scandal, but I'd typically assume the coverage isn't actually lying.

Additionally, I think Dems may be more likely to honestly respond, ""I don't know"" when talking about news agencies they've never seen. This skews the stats, so that only Dems who watch OAN are including in the calcs. However, Republicans have been told non-stop that NYT and most other media outlets are untrustworthy, so they accept that without checking.",false,1685707732.0,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/13xwtgn/oc_trust_in_media_2023_what_news_outlets_do/jmlqc13/,jmlqc13

1. Why would you exclude those who neither trust nor distrust? Deems to me that would skew the data away from neutral. If e.g. a lot of people are neutral, and a select few are voiced, you now only show the voices ones. (Excluding ""don't know"" seems fine and logical).  
2. The scale seems a bit ambiguous/unclear. From what I understand, it does not differentiate between ""(un)trustworthy"" and ""very (un)trustworthy"". Would a weighted scaling not be more representative, albeit maybe more difficult to apply? And to add: an example calculation in the head text would help clarify the current unclarity in what the scale means, in my opinion. E.g. ""a score of +50 could indicate 70% trustworthy - 20% untrustworthy, and 10% don't know"".
3. There seems to be an error with the Infowars number: the average is now left of Democrats, instead if between them and Republicans. Is this correct? If so, is that due to unaffiliated or other party voters?

So many outlets competing for democrats' attention, and relatively few who go after the whole other half of the country.

249,false,Oh_IHateIt,"Ok so I dont even need to say that Republicans live on a diet of conspiracy theories and manufactured rage BUT

There are serious problems with the major trusted news networks. They have agendas. Two examples:

About 10 years ago a statistic was released regarding the daily crime section of CNN and its local branches. Over 50% of the covered crimes were committed by African Americans, despite that group only committing ~15% of crimes. Usually deli stickups or purse snatching, the kind of thing that happens dozens of times a day per city. Looking back on it as I watched those programs myself... despite being 'left leaning', they were ABSOLUTELY trying to subliminally create a negative association, all while manufacturing fear about high crime.

Another was when we committed a genocide of 1 million people in Indonesia. CIA reports show that the NYT as well as others had journalists that were aware of the issue, but those journalists were asked by their higher ups not to report or to report misleadingly. Funny enough, a number of fringe underfunded left leaning newspapers from the time can now be shown to have been more accurate than the major networks. Our present ownership of Indonesia is still hush hush.

For those a million other reasons you should not trust major networks or the prevailing narratives in our country. Being smarter than a Republican is an abysmally low bar to clear - dont assume that your opinions are infallible and immune to manyfacturing.

505,false,Willing_Entertainer1,"Lots of people still reject the notion that racism today is less about the overt prejudice of the past. It’s more about systems of power. The US systems incentivize “whiteness.” This isn’t a culture but it does replace traditional culture. It’s doing what “whiteness” tells us is correct. Individualism, working/labor, consumerism, value comes from what you achieve (the house, the car, being able to retire, etc). 

Republicans more and more are people who are subscribing to this idea of “whiteness” even if they aren’t white. They are still subscribing to the idea. To them, they already know how things should be because the racist culture has told them. So they don’t listen to news to be informed, they listen to news to be reassured they are still right and to identify who is still wrong.

Therefore, they don’t believe most of what they hear. 

The left/ democrats, are everyone else. Many still subscribe to the racist culture, but perhaps less strongly. Maybe some aspect of culture isn’t jiving with them, but it’s more piecemeal. Like they don’t like how healthcare works, or don’t feel like we should be working ourselves to death, or they do recognize that people are unfairly treated by systems and those systems should be corrected. But ultimately most still believe in the core structure (jobs, individualism, capitalism, etc). However, when they seek out news, they are seeking to be informed. Even a source they highly distrust will cause them to consider it before completely rejecting it outright. They have doubt about the world they live in, so any new info might help them understand this doubt. 

Hence, why they trust more in general.",false,1685722767.0,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/13xwtgn/oc_trust_in_media_2023_what_news_outlets_do/jmmpf5i/,jmmpf5i

541,false,Professional_Mud_316,"Long ago, journalism tended to challenge the powers-that-be in order to truly comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable in an increasingly unjust global existence. Now, it has largely become a profession motivated more by a regular company paycheck and frequently published name/face with stories or opinions.

And not just CNN and Fox News are guilty of this.

Also troubling is that mainstream news-outlet websites, including The Washington Post's, are increasingly converting to 'pay-to-say' formats, where the reader is allowed to consume the article without charge but must buy a subscription in order to comment on the article.

Meantime, there still are reporters and editors who will (as though with big innocent fawn-like eyes) reply to accusations of subjective journalism with, ‘Who, me? I’m just the messenger.’

Whatever the news media may be, they are not ‘just the messenger’; nor are they but a reflection of the community — or their consumership, for that matter — in which they circulate.

And perhaps such compromised or subjective journals have become normalized, along with ethical (and sometimes even moral) standards gradually lowered.
