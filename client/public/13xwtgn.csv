They generally take their news with a degree of skepticism... except when it tells them something they already believe.  -  - CNN and MSNBC tout themselves as being unbiased and accurate and many people take that at face value. It goes often completely unchallenged and swallowed hookline and sinker. The vehemence of distrust of those sources is sort of compensating for the blind trust they perceive others to have of it. -  - Think of it this way. Look at chain restaurants vs mom and pop restaurants. A small sandwich shop might be able to get away with loose health standards. They might not keep their tuna at a perfect temperature. They might keep their cooked meats next to their raw meats in the back. They might even accidentally get someone sick once in a while, but no one would care or fault them. If they generally have good tasting sandwichs the yelp reviews will be 4.5 or higher. If they make sandwiches that aren't for a particular person that person will probably just not eat there and not leave reviews. If someone has a bad experience they will usually still give it 3-4 stars. If they have a good experience it will get 5 stars and people feel like they are helping out a small business.  -  - A Subway sandwiches on the other hand will almost never get above 4 stars no matter how exceptional they are. They absolutely have to adhere to the most rigorous of safety standards or they can lose the ability to keep the franchise. Their food is the result of decades and millions of dollars of market research. If you took 100 people who had never had either restaurant and had never heard of Subway the majority of them would probably say Subway was better. But because it's a chain and well known and people have had their sandwiches many times in their lives, even a slight deviation from that standard will yield one star reviews. Not 3 or 4 stars but 1. In fact 3-4 star reviews are usually going to be representive of a good experience. They have to be blown away in some way usually to give a Subway a 5 star review. -  - People generally hate subway because it's perceived as the establishment, and are very quick to share and perpetuate exaggerated facts (like the cake vs bread finding in Ireland) or even obviously false facts (Subway Tuna isn't really tuna).  -  - CNN and MSNBC are perceived as ""the establishment"" in much the same way.

If I took this survey, I'd believe it was asking, essentially, how often the organization tells outright truths or outright lies. When Republicans refer to fake news, they typically are referring to biased news. So, for example, if the New York Times ran several front page stories on the Trump classified documents scandal, and only ran a few minor stories on the Biden document scandal, I'd say that's indicative of trustworthiness; they didn't lie about anything. Republicans would consider that indicative of untrustworthiness; the reporting was biased (in their eyes at least). -  - So, I don't regularly see things from OAN or Newsmax, but I'd assume that most of their coverage is factual, although likely biased. So they may run non-stop news stories about the Biden document scandal and only a few minor stories about Trump's document scandal, but I'd typically assume the coverage isn't actually lying. -  - Additionally, I think Dems may be more likely to honestly respond, ""I don't know"" when talking about news agencies they've never seen.

From what I understand, it does not differentiate between ""(un)trustworthy"" and ""very (un)trustworthy"". Would a weighted scaling not be more representative, albeit maybe more difficult to apply? And to add: an example calculation in the head text would help clarify the current unclarity in what the scale means, in my opinion. E.g. ""a score of +50 could indicate 70% trustworthy - 20% untrustworthy, and 10% don't know"". - 3.

Funny enough, a number of fringe underfunded left leaning newspapers from the time can now be shown to have been more accurate than the major networks.
