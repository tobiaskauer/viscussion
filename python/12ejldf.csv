I count Parks and Rec among my favorite shows, if not my favorite, and going back and watching the first season is strange after having seen any other episodes.

Later on, Leslie is nowhere near that ignorant, and Tom is over the top and opportunistic about everything; he’d never just get annoyed and correct someone who assumed he was an immigrant. He’d say something wacky, or capitalize on it). Whatever they were trying to do with Mark just didn’t fit the show. Season 2 introduces two major characters who really tie the show together, and unlike Mark, have actual distinct personalities rather than just “bland white guy who looks at the camera, disdainful of his colleagues with actual character traits.” Season 1 is more like a long pilot for the show that starts at season 2. At best, it’s background information about why Chris and Ben needed to come to Pawnee.

I appreciate American Dad is also more experimental in it's episodes and formula. One of my favorite episodes is barely a comedy and more like the Twilight zone. The episode is called 'Nighthawks Hideaway'. It is very reminiscent of an 'SCP'. One of the new episodes ""Gold Top Nuts"" plays around with what it is to decipher the world around us when we have no knowledge or reference of our existence and how belief systems can develop from the small things we can discern. The characters are not as flanderized as those in Family Guy. Roger. Roger is so unhinged he can literally be anything. Family Guy feels like the safe bet in terms of revenue. American Dad being more low-key seems to allow the writers to deviate from the formula more so than Family Guy. American Dad characters feel more fluid to me. I don't know. I used to be in the Family Guy camp, but it became stale to me. Later American Dad seasons, on rewatch, seem to get much more creative. Plus, the main characters (imo) are more likable people.

563,jfc44ge,false,Sillygooseman23,"one aspect of IMDB ratings to keep in mind is a lot of people are rating these seasons relative to the other seasons of the show, not compared to other shows. So the IMDB ratings, while as close as we can get to a true ratings system, aren’t creating 1 to 1 comparisons between shows with the ratings. Its just how the human brain works — the last couple seasons of family guy, for example, are honestly just as funny to me as anything on tv because they have their formula nailed down so tight. I’d rather throw on a late-stage family guy episode over Friends or Psych or Futurama. But it’s not fresh or new, and the early seasons had a garageband vibe to them bc they were raunchy for their time and had a cult following on Adult Swim after it got cancelled. no one who’s a fan is gonna rate the new seasons better than the original seasons. So later seasons will get rated “lower” than other TV shows, but the family guy fans who rated those seasons haven’t seen those other TV shows. It’s not a direct comparison. So that’s not EVERYONE who’s rating these shows, but most people who rate one show haven’t seen every single show ever. This turned into a Family Guy comment but my main point is, usually when a TV show “peaks”, those seasons & episodes are going to be rated much higher by fans than stuff that comes after.

How much of it is a general decline in quality vs how much is just because the audience is growing old and nostalgia is a powerful thing (like how everyone's favorite SNL era is usually the SNL era that was on when they were teenagers/college age). Beyond that, I wonder if the quantity of similar shows influences these results as well. It was easier for the Simpsons to be popular when it was really the main game in town as far as adult cartoons go, but nowadays there are plenty of other options to compare it too, in addition to all the previous seasons.

I don’t like to go to subreddits of fandoms that I like so I’m not sure what the real issue is but I think it might be a combination of things. I think the thing that throws people off is how different the first few seasons are, it starts with dark comedy and transitions to more wholesome. I love all the seasons but I think what turns people off is that they wanted another Family Guy/American Dad type show but it doesn’t stay that way. I think the other issue is that more and more people review things, especially negative reviews. There’s a pretty clear line in 2010 where mostly every show has a drop off and I doubt that all shows just started dipping for no reason. I think it correlates to a rise in online reviews and people are much more inclined to negatively review something than they are to go out of their way to positive review something.
