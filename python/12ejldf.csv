I appreciate American Dad is also more experimental in it's episodes and formula. One of my favorite episodes is barely a comedy and more like the Twilight zone. The episode is called 'Nighthawks Hideaway'. It is very reminiscent of an 'SCP'. One of the new episodes ""Gold Top Nuts"" plays around with what it is to decipher the world around us when we have no knowledge or reference of our existence and how belief systems can develop from the small things we can discern. The characters are not as flanderized as those in Family Guy. Roger. Roger is so unhinged he can literally be anything. Family Guy feels like the safe bet in terms of revenue. American Dad being more low-key seems to allow the writers to deviate from the formula more so than Family Guy. American Dad characters feel more fluid to me. I don't know. I used to be in the Family Guy camp, but it became stale to me. Later American Dad seasons, on rewatch, seem to get much more creative. Plus, the main characters (imo) are more likable people.

But it‚Äôs not fresh or new, and the early seasons had a garageband vibe to them bc they were raunchy for their time and had a cult following on Adult Swim after it got cancelled. no one who‚Äôs a fan is gonna rate the new seasons better than the original seasons. So later seasons will get rated ‚Äúlower‚Äù than other TV shows, but the family guy fans who rated those seasons haven‚Äôt seen those other TV shows. It‚Äôs not a direct comparison.

Beyond that, I wonder if the quantity of similar shows influences these results as well. It was easier for the Simpsons to be popular when it was really the main game in town as far as adult cartoons go, but nowadays there are plenty of other options to compare it too, in addition to all the previous seasons.

I don‚Äôt like to go to subreddits of fandoms that I like so I‚Äôm not sure what the real issue is but I think it might be a combination of things. I think the thing that throws people off is how different the first few seasons are, it starts with dark comedy and transitions to more wholesome. I love all the seasons but I think what turns people off is that they wanted another Family Guy/American Dad type show but it doesn‚Äôt stay that way. I think the other issue is that more and more people review things, especially negative reviews. There‚Äôs a pretty clear line in 2010 where mostly every show has a drop off and I doubt that all shows just started dipping for no reason. I think it correlates to a rise in online reviews and people are much more inclined to negatively review something than they are to go out of their way to positive review something.
