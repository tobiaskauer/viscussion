I don't disagree with the message this post is trying to send, but I do disagree with the methods. Showing two charts that look the same is NOT the same thing saying the data are correlated. If the data actually *are* correlated, show me that they're correlated.   
  
Other red flags:     
  
*  The first chart is ""percentages of"" and the second one is ""total number of"". Since we have a higher population in 2020 than in 2000, you'd expect a positive trend, regardless of what is happening per-capita.     
  
*  The range of data in the first chart is within 1 percentage point, and seems to fluctuate quite a bit even within that range. The data we're seeing may not be representative of an actual trend.  
  
*  The first graph is grouped by month, and the second is grouped by year. It would be easy enough to just sum up all the month-to-month data into bins of 1 year, and display the data that way. So much so that I find it suspicious why it isn't done this way.   I wonder if seasonal fluctuations in month-to-month obituaries could be artificially affecting the results. ~~For example, let's say you had 100 deaths in the first half of the year, 1 of which was sudden, and 1000 deaths in the second half of the year, 50 of which were sudden.  The former gives us a sudden rate of 1%, and the latter gives us a sudden rate of 0.5%: Both within our range.  If you put a trendline between the two points, it would fall somewhere in the 0.75% range.~~. Edit: bad example. My math doesn’t work.  
But if you sum them together and calculate it for the whole year, you get 51 deaths in 1100 people, which works out to 0.46%; lower than both values.   
  
  
   
All that being said, I think it is a very fascinating concept to explore and I commend OP for putting the work to put this together.  I'd love to see more on the subject, maybe both as per-capita or both as percentages, in similar bin sizes, and with some sort of statistical correlation test performed.",False,1661973309.0,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/x2jj3s/obituaries_saying_someone_died_suddenly_closely/imk6qzu/

I tried a few different ways to visualize the data here. I used percentages in the top chart because the total number of obituaries available in the dataset changed over time (I'm guessing due to changing publisher agreements with NewsBank).

I was limited in my choice of dataset. NewsBank maintains the only database I know that lets you get monthly aggregations of search term frequency in obituaries. The increase over the course of the timeframe being visualized is quite large, which suggests a real increase in the greater population of obituaries. In other words, I strongly believe that I would see an increase in the use of the word ""suddenly"" if I had a copy of every obituary published in the United States.

Instead of combining the monthly data into yearly data, I used a loess smoother, which resulted in a line that looks very similar to the line using annualized obituary data.

168,False,bigtim3727,"I call the opioid epidemic millennial Vietnam, just bc I knew sooooooo many people—including myself—that were heavily into some sort of opioid, and we had many that died—and are still dying way, *way* too young. Granted, the opioid crisis has effected everyone, but the *shocking* availability of them made them *extremely easy* to obtain. We barely had any money as kids, and yet, we had access to hundreds of pills.

It was 2005 when I first took a Vicodin, and like most people, I fell in love instantaneously; I was 16 at the time. One kid in the group of the wanna-be-gangsta white kids, dropped a bottle of 60 Vic ES 7.5mg—the weird looking oval one with squares on the back—and my buddy picked it up, and after reading Erowid (how many of us got all our drug info from that site as kids?!) we knew what to do.

Fast forward to 07’—my senior year— and a shocking amount of people are not only into pills, but selling them as well. I remember being really annoyed when the dealers would sell out, like “wtf who is buying all this shit?! There can’t be *that many* users!!” Me, along with two other friends would split a bottle of 100 Vicodin 10MG—hated that they always called them “thousands”, making so many shitbirds think they’re  actually 1000MG of Vicodin. This is before the phone internet, and bullshit was even thicker with shit like that— for $350 every so often, but the OCs— those were in highest demand. Then blues came out, etc…..Then…..

Heroin. It all seemed to start with the girl I was with at the time. We did pills together, but right after HS she started using dope IV . We had broken up before that, but she shot up in front of me one day when we were hanging out, and it completely freaked me the fuck out. It really bothered me she was doing it—she was a straight up dime piece too, no shit, and very popular. Once she started, it was a domino effect that sucked in an insane amount of people in. 

Although I was dead set against it at first, by feb 2008, I too was sucked in; it ended up sucking in my friend almost the same day, and then it spread from him, to one of our other friends. If you told me in 2005, about all the kids that would up being intravenous drug users by 2008, I would have never believed you in 1000000 years…..

I start dating a girl I went to school with, and I was clean, but using subs. I had been prescribed subs, but I was buying them off the street bc my insurance ended. GF was an extreme control freak, said I needed to stop blah blah. I say “ok” but no way that’s gunna happen. She’s somewhat opiate naive at the time, but just sorta discovering Oxys for the first time. She pretends she doesn’t like them that much, but her actions speak otherwise. She befriends the NP that takes care of her grandmother, and she comes up some BS about her back. Guess what? Somehow, she gets the NP to prescribe her *90* oxycodone 30MG per month!! At age 21 FFS!! I knew dope was in her future, and sure enough, by 2013 she’s shootin up, and doin tricks 

Fast forward to 2017; I’m clean for 6 years, but another close friend of ours passes, and this one really stings. All of them are awful, but losing her really hurts. This girl possessed a genius-level intellect; she was the valedictorian of my class, and by all means, had a bright future. Only problem is, when you start heroin at such a young age, it completely fucks that up. I’ve been clean since 2012, but I still have *many* things I need to fix, and may never fix at this point
