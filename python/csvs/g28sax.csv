97,fnkv0z2,fnk6wu4,Originally_Sin,"The Civil War didn't happen because there were shitty presidents. They were shitty presidents because of the lead up to the Civil War. WH Harrison died of pneumonia a month after taking office, so his low rating is mostly from not having the chance to accomplish anything more than due to being actively bad as president. Tyler would be the first president to be considered for impeachment and, after leaving office, later be one of those who voted for Virginia's secession from the Union and be elected to the Confederate House of Representatives. Taylor died a year into his presidency without managing to make any progress with regards to the tension over slavery; Fillmore would push through the Compromise of 1850, making them the second instance of ineffective short-term president succeeded by a far-right/pro-slavery/nativist Vice President who pushed the issue of slavery further down the road while siding with increasingly minority pro-slavery interests. Pierce supported the Kansas-Nebraska act, leading to armed conflicts in Kansas between pro- and anti-slavery factions that would last up until the start of the Civil War. Buchanan supported the Dred Scott decision and was felt to have a poor response to the secession of the South at the end of his term, being unable to prevent more states from seceding in spite of taking a more compromise approaching stance. On the other side of things, Johnson was exceedingly lenient with the returning Southern states and opposed the 14th Amendment, which granted citizenship to former slaves and (nominally) granted them equal protection under the law.   –-  –-  –- In essence, the reason they all rate so low is that they either died very quickly with no real accomplishment, were conciliatory towards the growing division over slavery and took weak stances towards the growing conflict, or outright supported slavery and promoted pro-slavery legislation during their time in office. It's not that, at the time, they were seen as bad presidents, though most were very polarizing and the succeeding VPs in particular were unpopular with their Cabinets and Congress due to the radically different stances they took from their predecessors coupled with the stigma of not having actually won an election. They rank low now because we know their actions or lack thereof did not abate or outright encouraged the increasing divide between pro- and anti-slavery movements that would lead to the Civil War.   –-  –-  –- Trump is a bad president more on the terms of Harding. Harding earned his low rating due to things like appointing his Cabinet based on nepotism. For example, he appointed a friend as Secretary of the Interior who would later become the first Cabinet member to be jailed for crimes committed in office after he sold drilling rights to a Navy oil reserve in exchange for bribes. He also appointed one of the richest bankers as Secretary of the Treasury, who would later advise him to cut income tax on the extremely wealthy. He was anti-union and broke campaign promises to support anti-lynching laws. Essentially, he was an ineffective president who gave power based on personal connection rather than expertise to people who would abuse those positions for personal gain. We didn't end up in a major war or a nation divided due to him, though, so I wouldn't point to Trump's atrocious performance and start worrying about the next Civil War just yet.",False,1587040679.0,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/g28sax/us_presidents_ranked_across_20_dimensions_oc/fnkv0z2/,1280

However, my one issue is that Woodrow Wilson is a horrible president, and should not be ranked 11th.  Let's ignore everything he did that is politically skewed.  Most liberals will like the stuff he did in this regard, and most conservatives will dislike this.  Let's just go over the stuff he did that the vast majority of us will agree was awful. –-  –- 1.  This somehow gets glossed over but Wilson was racist as fuck, and was a huge part of segregating the government.  So not only was he racist, but he acted on that racism in a way that took decades to overcome. –-  –- 2.  He got us unnecessarily involved in WW1.  I get the argument for declaring war on Germany after U-Boat incidents, and the Zimmerman telegram.  However, the US could have been involved economically without sending over millions of troops.  This led to a lot of really bad things as I'll go over later. –-  –- 3.  As part of the war Wilson took over the economy and suspended basic rights like Habeas Corpus completely unnecessarily.  He used the war as a excuse to take away fundamental rights from people.   –-  –- 4.  He was a big opponent of allowing women to vote, and for years was a huge reason the 19th amendment took as long to pass as it did. –-  –- 5.  Because of Wilson's intervention the Allied Powers won WW1 convincingly (not a good thing).  This created a situation where France and England were vengeful winners and were going to enact punitive measures on Germany (a huge cause of Hitler's rise and WW2).   –-  –- 6.  Wilson could have used his political capital to try and prevent such punitive measures, but instead used it to force the League of Nations down everyone's throat.  This was an interesting idea (and the United Nations has done some good), but was overly idealistic at the time (plus Wilson really fucked up the execution of it). –-  –- 7.  After spending all his political capital forming this League of Nations, the Congress didn't want to back it 100%.  So instead of compromising Wilson try to force it through as is, and created a situation where the US completely rejected the Treaty, and didn't join the League of Nations at all.  So basically Wilson created the League of Nation, and almost immediately killed it. –-  –- 8.  Oh and to top it all off Wilson had a stroke and was definitely not capable of being President, but refused to step down, and helped his wife basically act as President for the end of his term. –-  –- So basically Wilson was a racist who abused his power, and is the person most single handily responsible for WW2.
