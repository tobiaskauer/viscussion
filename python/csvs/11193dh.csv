106,j8dvrdr,uTzQMVpNgT4rksF6fV,"Hi! You didn't really get an answer for why things are like this in the US, so I thought I would give a bit of context.

Banks keep a set of records (""books"", but they are all electronic now, of course) about what the transactions happening to an account are. When a transfer is made, whether via paper cheque or wire, the bank can't record that transfer on their books until it is also recorded on the books of the other bank. I.e. you send me a paper cheque, my bank holds on to it until it can talk to your bank,then they both record the transaction at the same time. This process is called ""clearing"".

Back before computers, the process for clearing in a city was that every night, all the banks would take all the cheques and a bunch of cash to a central location (the Clearing House), and do all their clearing at once. As you can imagine, this was a pretty challenging affair, and also limiting because you couldn't clear cheques out of town. Larger banks would mail cheques to appropriate branches for clearing, meaning that it could take days for cheques to clear. Obviously, computer networking could make a big difference to this. This lead to the creation of the Automated Clearing House (ACH).

The first ACH system started processing in Britain in 1968. Other countries quickly followed, and most countries in the world today have at least one ACH system. The United States has two, one run by the government and one by a private company. ACH systems used to do one clearance a day, during the night, and if there where issues with it, would be manually reconciled later (this is why it used to take several days for money from a cheque to appear in an account). Today, the American ACH systems run roughly every two hours, which is much better. So, using ACH, you can do an electronic cheque relatively quickly. But not instantly.

Old ACH systems predate the Internet, so the method of operation they were built on was batch processing: call up a central server and upload a file. This method of clearing is still the prime one used in the United States. In contrast, the EU, Canadian, and other jurisdictions evolved to include systems which allow for clearance of individual transactions done in real time. The EU, for instance, has the RT1 system that has been facilitating instant transfers since 2017, with other fast-transfer systems of more limited scope existing long before. 

Across the world, people have been aware of the limitations of these systems, and in areas where infrastructural solutions didn't exist, other solutions were built. PayPal predates most instantaneous clearing, for instance. Other services such as Venmo were founded to compete, and some such as WePay were created to facilitate money transfer in under-banked areas. Since 2011, a group of US banks have themselves participated in a scheme for instant transfer.

Zelle, originally called clearXchange, is a private company owned by several large American banks that facilitates instant transfer. Each bank holds a special account full of money for the Zelle transfers, and when a person sends money through Zelle, the money is actually transferred to and from these accounts. The transaction is then sent over Zelle's secure infrastructure, where the recipient is paid from the other banks Zelle account. Finally, the two banks reconcile the transfer through the normal clearing process later. Zelle isn't as popular as European equivalents for several reasons:
* strong pre-existing competitive services
* Accessed through bank website or app but separate branding makes it weird (and who wants weird with their money?)
* highly publicized incidents of fraud
* not available to every bank

Despite this, Zelle is broadly available and is gaining market share. Compared to Venmo or PayPal, it has the advantage that transferred funds are immediately available to your bank account. Venmo and Paypal must provide them via electronic cheque, which is subject to the ACH process previously discussed.

Edit: although founded in 2011, Zelle didn't begin processing until 2017, hence the relative newness of the system.",False,1676379465.0,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/11193dh/oc_what_foreign_ways_of_doing_things_would/j8hw07s/,j8hw07s

289,j8dje9u,rpresserreturns,"Nearly everywhere, it is illegal to drink ""in public"" -- meaning, outside, on the street or in somebody's yard.  (Obviously back yards don't result in many citations.)  It's also illegal to drink while driving, and if you are stopped and an open container is found in the car, that's a violation too. Even if you weren't drinking, and you blow a 0.00 blood alcohol level on the breathalyzer, you will get cited for having an open container.

*Every single town* can individually set their own rules to restrict where drinking is legal, or more importantly, restrict where it is legal to **sell** liquor.  In many states, you can buy beer or wine in a supermarket. You cannot in New Jersey or Pennsylvania; no town in those states is allowed to relax that rule.  In the town where I live, there are a handful of bars and liquor stores and restaurants that will serve you if you're eating there. In the neighboring town, there are **none**.  Of course this doesn't keep people from drinking -- it's quite easy to come over to my town from the dry town.

If you run a restaurant and it's not in a dry town, you may still have great difficulty obtaining a liquor license. A majority of large towns and cities will never issue new licenses unless an existing one is given up. For example, if you're opening your BBQ restaurant in a building that previously had a Chinese restaurant with a liquor license, you can likely arrange to get the license transferred; but if there are 30 restaurants in this zone and you're #31 and none of the 30 want to give up their license, you won't be getting a license.

The laws can get way, way more complicated than this, and like I said, every single town in the US may have different laws about liquor.",False,1676325955.0,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/11193dh/oc_what_foreign_ways_of_doing_things_would/j8fcpfk/,j8fcpfk

Based on how companies typically behave, I doubt that would be pulled from CEO wages, shareholder kickbacks, etc. It would come from either their customers, by raising prices, or more likely from the employees, by lowering salaries.

Look at the EU vs US for an example: wages are significantly lower in the EU, but in exchange you get a lot of ""freebies"" - more vacation time, healthcare, longer parental leave, etc. A LOT goes into this, obviously, not just national vacation policies, but it does seem reasonable that policies like this would influence wages.

There's also the downside that any new mandate comes with bureaucratic costs. US taxpayers will need to fund enforcement of this mandate. Everyone will of course weigh the benefit of the proposed law vs the cost of enforcing it differently, but it is something which should be considered.

Personally, I prefer the flexibility of not having the government mandate this. If I value vacation time over wages, I will work for a company which offers lots of vacation time, or negotiate that for myself.

That being said, and this is why America gets confusing. The alcohol industry lobbied hard against raising the drinking age.

They failed, they have tried to get it lowered down to 18, but have had no luck.

Its been anti-drunk driving groups along with religious groups as well and other odd members of a coalition that have prevented the drinking age from dropping to 18.

In a weird twist, university presidents would like to see it dropped down to 18 because of all the headaches they have to deal with (where kids will go off campus, drink at a house and then drive back) as opposed to drinking and staying ON campus.

Its also why a lot of campuses have to stay ""dry"" becuase the school doesn't want to deal with the laws regarding underage drinking (which they know happens).

Its a very weird mix that makes for strange bedfellows. I had a professor in college who turned the idea of lowering the drinking age to 18 into a weird anti-corporate rant about how capitalism would lower the drinking age to being able to crawl if ""corporate overlords"" had their way.

Roundabouts are awesome. Americans are stupid and roundabouts just make this self evident.

Drinking age laws go back to the Puritanical/religious bullshit history of this country. I grew up in south Louisiana and the effective drinking age was ""could you see over the counter and did you have money"". That was bad. I'd rather see the recruitment age go up than the drinking age go down. Except the Pentagon, like Big Tobacco knows its better to get them young and dumb.

Nobody WANTS the stall gaps, but crimes can happen in them I guess. I just always thought it was about shitty design and construction. But its probably about shitting on workers.

America is stupid when it comes to taxes, as others have said.

This prevents alcohol from being used as much high school or being super accessible, as most 19 year olds are away for university. But allows first years in university to be able to drink, and experience university life and potentially learn how to safely use alcohol, and there’s not all this red tape about alcohol at parties or worrying about the law etc. 

It’s weird how it’s 21 in the US because your first 3 years you can’t legally drink so throwing parties in university becomes way more complicated and students may not learn how to be more responsible with alcohol use due to it being illegal till that age.

I think the large issue in American culture of reckless use of alcohol at a young age, stems partially from it being so taboo till the age of 21. And thus people under 21 using it more like a “drug” and getting absolutely hammered underaged at parties, rather than learning how to have a glass of wine or two at dinner or casually.

I teach engineering. Engineers almost universally would prefer using the SI system, which generally has easier unit conversions in a lot of areas (Energy), and would mean not using two unit systems for fabrication in or out of the US. 

On the other hand, I worked carpentry jobs with my dad in high-school and college, and spend a lot of free time doing woodworking and DIY home improvement projects. Trades-workers, familiar with imperial units, are one of the groups least interested in switching to metric. 

Even after seeing both sides, most arguments in favor of imperial units are weak. Almost all the ""tricks"" you can do with base-12 feet or binary fractions have a similarly easy equivalent method in a decimal system, plus quite a few things that are much easier to calculate in a decimal system.

I got in legal trouble for it twice. The first time I was 17 and still in highschool and got charged with ""Minor in consumption/possession of alcohol"" for drinking at a party. I had to go to court and didn't want my parents to have to pay for a lawyer for something so stupid and assumed since I had never been in trouble and partying in high school was extremely common in my town that it wouldn't be a big deal.

I ended up with 1 year of supervised probation. I had to bring report cards into meetings with a probation officer every other Friday for a year and take a drug test with someone standing over my shoulder. I had to do 40 hours of community service (mostly just organized used books at a thrift store on weekends, super boring). I had to take a alcohol abuse class that was 4 sessions over the span of a month. Most painfully, I lost my driver's license for a year (was not driving, was drinking at a house party). Was a pretty big bummer to lose my driver's license for my senior year since I had a job, played sports and also drove my little brother to school and back since we went to the same school. I also grew up in a state that had the lowest age for drivers licenses, so I had a car and a part time job when I was 14. Was tough to go from all of that freedom to having to rely on friends and parents for rides to get anywhere. 

It was an absolutely ridiculous punishment for drinking beer at a gathering of 17 and 18 year olds.

The second time I had the same charge, but I was over 18 and it was a college party. It was the same state, so the law was the same, but once you turned 18 the penalty was reduced to a 150$ fine, which was annoying as a poor college student, but much preferable to my previous experience.",False,1676307139.0,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/11193dh/oc_what_foreign_ways_of_doing_things_would/j8e17ee/,j8e17ee

Spoiler: >!Sadly, not cabbage related. =(!<

&nbsp;

> All areas in a town or city are accessible by sidewalks, making it easier to walk anywhere

Absolutely would love, but without some major investments in infrastructure I don't see this happening any time soon.

> Sales tax is included in the price of items on store shelves, so the price displayed is the same as you pay at the checkout.

Again, would love. Once upon a time, this wouldn't have been feasible, but with the advent and integration of computers into our daily lives this is absolutely something that could happen. Fairly easily I'd wager.

> A national minimum paid-vacation allowance, on top of federal holidays

Where do I sign? Sadly, with how powerful the lobbyists are for major corporations, this isn't likely.

> Wait staff are paid a higher minimum wage that means you are not expected to tip them

I've never worked as a waiter, but I am all for supporting those that do.

> Being able to easily send people money directly from your bank account to theirs using your bank's website or app, rather than using payment apps like Venmo or writing checks

I've not heard of this. Is it really a thing in other countries? I'm all for it, however, I worked IT for a bank for 8 years, and when I say shit is outdated, well... that's a massive understatement.

> Not having gaps down the sides of toilet stall doors that mean the person inside the stall can be seen from outside

I'll sign the petition for this yesterday.

> Electric kettles that can boil water quickly, rather than using a stove or a microwave

Meh, either way. I don't find myself needing boiling water quickly very often.

> It being legal to drink alcohol outside or in public places, so long as you are not behaving in a disorderly way

Sure, why not. I have about 3 drinks a year, but I don't have a problem with this.

> The government calculating your tax and automatically deducting it from every paycheck, meaning employees don't have to fill in tax returns every year

Gladly. However, does this mean we wouldn't get a return, or simply that I don't have to fill one out?

> Smaller portion sizes at restaurants and fast-food outlets

As someone that's struggled with weight all their life, I wholeheartedly approve. While it wouldn't solve the issue, I really feel like it would be a major help.

> Using a bidet to clean yourself after having used the toilet

Never used one, however, I am looking to get one.

> Much greater use of traffic circles or roundabouts instead of traffic light intersections

I leave somewhat close to the  self-appointed (IIRC) ""[Roundabout capital of the world](https://www.carmel.in.gov/government/departments-services/engineering/roundabouts#:~:text=Carmel%20is%20internationally%20known%20for,city%20in%20the%20United%20States.)"". Whenever I have to travel to or through there, I've never had any issues with traffic. It always seems to move pretty swiftly, so yes. I would love it.

> Having the legal age at which someone can buy and drink alcohol set at 18

While I agree with the premise, I feel like we need better education and a cultural shift on drinking for this to be feasible.

> Using the metric system for all measures

I absolutely want this. I hate having seemingly arbitrary measurements. `5280 feet/mile` <<<<< `1000 meters/kilometer`

> If a home has washers and/or dryers, they are kept in the kitchen or bathroom rather than a utility room

I could go either way on this. Sure it saves space, but I'm fortunate enough to have the space for them to be separate and I actually like it.

How it works here (Netherlands) is that the tax withheld on your paycheck is what the government estimates it to be. Then every year the gov sends us a proposal with how much tax they think we should have pay based on what they know, and we fix any parts that they didn't know about / got wrong. You send that back (or basically, you press the submit button on their website) and they calculate the difference between what was withheld that year and what we should actually pay. Then you either get an invoice for the extra or a rebate if you paid too much.

I have been to endless examples of tip-included (billed as ""no tip"") establishments.. and here are some of those experiences:

went to my favorite SF (iconic) restaurant last week, cuz love the atmosphere + farm-to-table menu.. and to see what their change to 'tip included' billing was like....

*  service was horrible - shockingly horrible, which was a big surprise
*  food/bev total was $360 (rounded, for TWO!).. glss of wine was $20 for about 3 ounces (maybe 3.5 oz if being generous)
* tip was $72, which brought the total to $432
* had to ask about this - because was vague - seemed that reciept brought for credit card signature was presented in a way in which custoemrs wouldn't ask about tip included vs. not included, and then tip on top of the included graturity (this felt shady, was insulted)
* I don't mind tipping 20% ($72 in this case).. but the service was awful - and since so bad, felt bamboozeled/conned.

In Europe, becasue reaturants operate on a no-tip basis,

* employ fewer waiters/waitresses.. and all service much slower
* sldo, if/when hear an American accent.. DO expect a tip on top of 'tip-included'
* I don't mind this so much -- not the decision of the waitrons, to cover many tables - slowing service.. do always tip on top of, b/c these waitrons are lovely (ALWAYS).. and b/c why not make a meal longer - so more of an experience than a phsyical need?

Recently got my car detailed....

* price was $250, I gave $100 tip upfront.. hoping the detailer would do a better job
* this backfired. he did a crap job... really lazy, not good work. 😣
* lesson learned, but made me sad

""All areas in a town or city are accessible by sidewalks, making it easier to walk anywhere.""

That's already an interesting one, especially as I hear more and more Americans wanting more walkable cities. Are there areas of towns in the US that are just not accessible by sidewalks at all? How do you even stop there, then?

""Wait staff are paid a higher minimum wage that means you are not expected to tip them.""

So just to be clear, in the US, tips are considered to be part of the wage in itself, and not a strictly optional bonus given voluntarily by clients ON TOP of a full wage? Also, yes, regardless of countries, minimum wages seriously need to be raised.

""Being able to easily send people money directly from your bank account to theirs using your bank's website or app, rather than using payment apps like Venmo or writing checks.""

Genuinely didn't know that wasn't an option in the US. You'd think if any country would support easy money transfers, that'd be the one.

""Electric kettles that can boil water quickly, rather than using the stove or a microwave.""

That one sounds a bit weird to me because I thought the problem wasn't specific appliances, but the fact that the US uses a lower voltage than Europe? Am I misunderstanding this point?

""It being legal to drink alcohol outside or in public places, so long as you are not behaving in a disorderly way.""

Question: does the illegality of it in the US include restaurant/bar terraces? Because that's quite BS if it does.

""The government calculating your tax and automatically deducting it from every paycheck, meaning emplyees don't have to fill in tax returns every year.""

That one's very interesting because here in France, this is relatively new and I remember there was a fair bit of controversy at the time, but once it was adopted, pretty much everyone went ""yeah okay, it actually is more convenient and helps budgetting for the month"" (it can also highight just how little you're actually being paid once you take taxes into consideration, thus encourage requesting a raise). Makes me wonder how many other European countries do it and for how long they've been doing it.



""Having the legal age at which someone can buy and drink alcohol set at 18.""

Oh, you other countries and your ""legal drinking ages""!

I think maybe it’s difficult to grasp how vast the United States are.  Most of the space here is empty and unused. In big, metropolitan cities, it’s pretty easy to walk around or take public transit but America has a driving culture. We get around in cars.  It’s actually worth pointing that out because it ties into the drinking age, for which it largely determined it. Individual states used to have their own legal drinking ages (this is back in the 1970s).  It started becoming a serious issue that kids would drive across state lines to places where the legal age was lower to score some booze and consequently there started to be a lot more underage, drunk driving accidents- this is at the time the interstate highway system is really being completed. It made it an imperative to make the legal age high enough across the entire federal system so that it would eliminate these drunken interstate beer runs. 

It’s generally a given that waitstaff has to live off your tips. Tipping for good service is a big deal but a lot of people are just super shitty about it. I’ve never understood why people are so resistant to paying for good service. 😑

The money thing…I don’t really get this.  We have a million of those apps but we also have Zelle which does exactly that- sends money bank to bank instantly.

No.  I like my car.  I hate malls, but in reality, I'm not walking 5 miles to the store, nor am I going to dedicate a couple hours to the bus to get to the store.   For the population densities we have with our suburban sprawl, this is not feasible.  

No.    We need to be more aware of taxes and able to do simple math.

Yes.   We need to encourage a cultural change towards more vacation.  

Yes.   We need the workers to control more of the means of production through higher wages.

Yes.   Drug development should happen in universities, and manufacture should be at most contracted.    There is no reason to advertise a thing a person might needs.  The public water utility doesn't advertise.

Yes  It would be cheaper and easier to not have a third party, but, it might be safer to have less access to my bank account.

No.   Nice to know someone is in there.  Good airflow and ease of mopping are nice too.     Would be nice to have bigger better dividers for the urinals though.

Yes.  They aren't that expensive if you want one.   Induction is quicker.

No.   Alcoholism is a scourge on society and it should be a hidden back room sort of thing.

Yes.    There's no reason I should have to tell them what they know.  They should tell me what they know, and let me disagree.     They already take the taxes out of my paycheck, which is questionable from an awareness standpoint.

Yes.   Smaller portion as an option, like a kids menu for older or thinner folks.  Alternatively, no charge for extra plates.

Yes.   I'd like to try a bidet, but I'm a bit scared.  Conceptually a good idea

Yes.   In theory safer and better flow.    They could use better signage on the ones I've been on.   They are confusing and scary because it is hard to tell what street you're getting off on if you don't use it all the time.

No.    Alcohol is a scourge on society.   It should be restricted more, or at least taxed to take care of addiction.

Yes.  Except for temperature.  Fahrenheit makes more sense.  0 is cold.  100 is hot.  I want to know if I should wear shorts or a sweater, I don't care about what number water boils at sea level, I'll put the pasta in when it boils at my altitude.

This is a heatedly debated subject for a long time, because people feel taken advantage of for supplementing worker wages instead of the employer... and rightfully so. I could write a dissertation on this so ill try and keep it brief. The short answer to your question is yes, quality of service would suffer. Your parallel of service standards in Europe is a common complaint, but I would further argue that you see a similar approach to service here in the states in fast food industries. Fast food and counter service eateries with no table service are paying minimum wage to their workers, and the food quality and service runs parallel with the wages being paid. Arguably, for sit down service and higher quality of food you would expect to pay more, and in turn, the workers would expected to be compensated more for providing service above that of fast food workers. The cost of the average meal would then rise in tandem to remain profitable, which In my opinion would put a vast majority of restaurants out of regular people's budgets. Currently, the tipping system bypasses a lot of tax requirements and the savings earned from these loopholes are being passed down to the customer by making prices still affordable. In all honesty if the government were to force the industry to compensate wait staff appropriately, I would bet money most would elect to pay staff minimum wage. This might work for corporate chains like Applebees or Chili's, where if you're paying about $25 for a steak dinner and the service expectations are relatively low, but would absolutely not be tenable for a place like the Capital Grille, where a bone-in ribeye is currently $73. The additional training and expectations for a fine dining waiter would not be tenable paying them minimum wage, so to accomplish staff retention their hourly compensation would have to be much higher, therefore raising prices up dramatically. 

It's really a conundrum.

People who know they can make more money by going out of their way will try to go out of their way if they are good at their job.  I've worked in both systems and the psychological pull of each system is too strong to ignore.  ALL THAT BEING SAID, the US is still not in a good spot for how to compensate restaurant and service staff.  First, federally it is still legal to pay service staff $2.33/hr.....this is criminal and exploitative.  I work in a very nice fine dining restaurant where I regularly go home with $300-$500 a night.  I started out in a corporate diner though where I would regularly go home with $30-$70 a night.  There needs to be a tip credit that takes into account how much servers are making.  People that make $50 a night need to make more to just hit minimum wage and people like me don't need to make more money on top of our tips.

Electric kettles are already widely available in America (just got my mom a stylish one as a gift, actually, with a chemex coffee maker). It sounds like this is more of a ""how much hot water do you need at a given time"" scenario, which varies widely based on your lifestyle.

I heat water on a stove because it's being used to boil/prep food. I'm not going to heat water in a kettle first, then pour it into a pot, I'll just heat it in a pot because I need a hot stove to begin with. If I make a single mug of a hot drink (instant coffee/cocoa/tea), I'll heat a single cup in the microwave. The time required for this vs a kettle is negligible, if even.

As a single guy who lives alone, I don't frequently need an abundance of pourable hot water, the exception being coffee. I don't use a chemex thing (pouring hot water onto grounds), I use a coffee maker, which is a pseudo-kettle. I do not even own a kettle.

Electric kettles? Ah, we have those.  I have one.  They are great but we still use the microwave a lot to heat up water.  Overall it's faster.  Kettle takes up additional limited counter space, and you have to fill that with water, heat it up and then put that in the vessel it needs to be in where you also get a lot of heat transfer losses.  With a microwave that gets used all the time, and is sometimes even mounted taking up no counter space, I put the water directly in the vessel it needs to be in. For electricity concerns I get it, but I pay 12 cents. 

For the wait staff, I'd be curious to this on proper knowledge.  Most people don't know that if you don't make minimum wage via tips, the employer pays the difference.

Washer and dryers need to be where the bedrooms are.  A lot of houses, all the rooms are upstairs.  The laundry is downstairs. That is stupid design.  Then you have houses where the master is on the main, with bedrooms upstairs.  These need two locations for laundry. For single floor with rooms on both sides of the house, it doesn't matter were it goes.  If all the rooms are on one side, put laundry on that side.  For all these and above, I don't even care if the laundry is in a closet cutout in the hallway.",False,1676307402.0,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/11193dh/oc_what_foreign_ways_of_doing_things_would/j8e1upf/,j8e1upf

There isn't any legal reason stopping businesses from voluntarily doing it though.

People living in larger metropolitan areas can be subject to different rates just by going to a different side of ""town"" if not just crossing the street.   If tax was included in displayed price, businesses with multiple locations spanning jurisdictions would then have different prices for the same items, complicating advertisements (increasing advertising cost, undoubtedly passed on to the consumer in some way).

Without an income tax, property and sales tax is where the state and local jurisdictions derive their operating income.  If you look at it from that perspective, that gives Texans a greater opportunity for local, democratic control over the taxes they pay than people in other states.

That sounds awesome, but how might it backfire.  When the threshold for requiring benefits was lowered to 3/4 time (30h/wk) companies started scheduling more people at <30h/wk, and prohibiting picking up extra shifts/overtime (that would put them over 30h/wk).  By attempting to help workers, we *accidentally* made things worse for them.

> Electric kettles that can boil water quickly, rather than using a stove or a microwave

We have such that do *okay,* but in order to have them work as fast as in Europe, you need an outlet with a higher voltage than our 120v standard.   

That said, I'm thinking that if I ever build a house myself, or have major renovations done, I may have a single 20A-240v outlet installed, so that I could have a 240v kettle for just this reason.


> Not having prescription-drug advertisements on TV

That's going to run afoul of the 1st Amendment, sadly.

> Smaller portion sizes at restaurants and fast-food outlets

People say that, but then they *choose* to get (e.g.) the large meal with the double cheeseburger instead of the small meal with the single patty.

> Much greater use of traffic circles or roundabouts instead of traffic-light intersections

Likewise, I'd like to see more Diverging Diamond intersections.  Sure, it still has 2-light-controlled paths (EB & WB crossing twice), similar to 2 lights current (NB->EB&WB, SB->EB&WB) but instead of 2 lights controlling 8 direction-pairs (NB -> WB, NB->EB, SB->WB, SB->EB, WB->NB, WB->SB, EB->NB, EB->SB), they only control *two* directions (E & W *crossing,* twice) and the 8 direction changes are just *yields.* The fact that the lights are sequential lights along the same direction(s) of traffic, that means they can be timed similar to how a sequence of lights on roads already are.

I don't own one anymore because my coffee maker takes care of my occasional tea and I couldn't justify the counter space for a once a week instant soup packet.

I would definitely say they aren't uncommon, but they aren't as ubiquitous as they are in other countries because the US just doesn't consume as much tea per capita. 59% of Americans drink coffee daily and the average is 2-3 cups. 34% of Americans drink tea daily, but 80% of all tea consumed in the US is iced tea. I've never met a person in the US who regularly drinks instant coffee, everyone I know who drinks coffee has some form of coffee maker, beit a pod system, peculator, or a more involved machine.

I used my kettle 95% of the time for tea and 5% of the time for soup. Once my coffee maker took over tea duty as well, it wasn't worth having a second appliance to make soup in when I can just put a pot in the stove and make it in that. While I can be impatient for coffee or tea as I may be taking it out of the house with me, my soup taking 4 extra minutes is never an issue.

Since tea and instant coffee aren't as big here and most coffee makers will also heat up water for tea, the main use of boiling water in the US is for cooking.

The amount of energy needed to boil water is the same so it's all efficiency. You want to heat the water and as few other things as possible.

An electric stove has to heat the stovetop first then the pot the water is in before heating the water more stuff to heat -> less efficient. A gas stove has to only heat the pot and the water but most of the heat escapes into the room making it less efficient than an electric one. An induction stove is roughly on the same level as the kettle since the heat is generated in the floor of the pot heating the water directly.

Smaller portion sizes: Weird thing to ask, this is the one thing I agree with, if the cost is the same ofc i want the portions to be big. But this is really a non-issue.

Roundabouts: I'm for them, but I understand why people would be against then, furthermore american streets and intersections are massive in comparison so it's not as bad. This can be left for later once the stuff above is taken care of.

the main reason why it feels way better to do it this way is that people generally build their kitchens etc with a specific fridge in mind, it will not look right with another model in there.

the result is that in other countries carl have owned houses in (or just visited a lot of people in) the kitchen just dont look as nice because the fridge and such seem a bit out of place.

makes much more sense that all those things are considered part of the house and left when moving. we refer to those type of products as ""white goods"" since they tend to be white but carl cant remember the english name for it.

also for some of these things carl think they needed more of a description for a fair result. like the roundabouts, if the text included that this is faster than using traffic lights carl is sure most americans would be for it, what is there to be opposed to? its faster and its safer, and its not like its hard to drive in one.

many of these dont make sense though. why is ANYONE opposed to sales tax being listed in the price instead of added at the cashier? it makes no sense why even 1% would want it to remain the way it is, because the way it is in USA right now is just stupid and there really is no benefit to it.",False,1676363543.0,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/11193dh/oc_what_foreign_ways_of_doing_things_would/j8hbi2n/,j8hbi2n
