I see by the scale that green is better than white, but it’s still confusing to look at the big picture with white being worse than green. And black is the worst?  Again it’s begging white to be the best.   A scale with white in the middle of two colors is suited for a measurement with positives and negatives. For instance pH. Base could be one color, acid could be another color, and white is balanced (7 I think).  – The other thing is, are these annual homicide rates really all that different?   – First, homicide rate > murder rate.  A homicide is a death at the hands of a human.  That includes accidental and justifiable.  – Second, black represents 15 of 100,000. That’s 1.5 basis points (percent of a percent).  That’s far from the max possible, particularly given how many guns we have. The news media feed and the general populace believe this narrative that every black person and white fascist is out there killing people every month. We certainly have a lot more murder than we’d like, but your risk of being killed is still fairly low.   – So there’s 3 things I find wrong with your color selection:   - 1.
