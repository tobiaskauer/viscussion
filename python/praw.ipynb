       "4    These are the definitions that the US uses as a sort of \"melting pot\" thing, where individual cultural identities are merged into a pre-determined race. Even though Cambodians and Kazakhs/Norwegians, Ukrainians and Maltese/African Americans and Somalis/hundreds of Native American nations are all different in culture and appearance and also in socioeconomic treatment within the United States, some people quickly assume that they're one and the same. –-  –- They're only used in official contexts like censuses and jobs, but people take the categories seriously and ignore in-group differences because they are used so often.

When we report diversity data on gender, the entire company is considered (engineering, marketing, sales, media, etc). Most (if not all) tech companies refuse to separate the \"technical\" women from the \"non-technical\" in their figures since their numbers would be abysmal - and at the end of the day, the number of technical women is the number most people care about. Electrical engineering, in particular, has the lowest percentage of women of all engineering disciplines (the degree you typically get to work in the semi space). I am usually the only woman on a large team of 40+. –- 2. Whenever I hear about diversity in tech, most people who are not in tech will talk about the issues like it\\'s all white men. Many people don\\'t realize that\\'s not the makeup of most companies as shown here. To work at these companies in a technical role, you typically need a masters or PhD in electrical engineering or computer science. 80% of all EE and CS masters graduates in the US are non-domestic (with most coming from India and China). –-  –- I don\\'t think people realize how many people are willing to move to the US and work their asses off for one of these high-paying positions and then typically wait 10-15 years to get a green card due to the country-specific queues. So few Americans go to graduate school in EE/CS that the actual divide at work is American-born versus not at all major semi companies I have worked at.',\n",
